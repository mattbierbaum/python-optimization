Python optimization
-------------------

A short tutorial on certain aspects of general speed optimization in Python,
discussing broad decisions about optimization including algorithms,
implementation, and hardware concerns.  Also, includes a short example centered
around the dynamics of people in mosh pits (based on arXiv:1302.1886).
